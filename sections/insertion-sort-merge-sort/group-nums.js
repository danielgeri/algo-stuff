/*You are given an integer array arr of size n. 
Group and rearrange them (in-place) into evens and odds in such a way that group of all even 
integers appears on the left side and group of all odd integers appears on the right side. 

Example

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: [4, 2, 1, 3]

Order does not matter. Other valid solutions are: 

[2, 4, 1, 3]
[2, 4, 3, 1]
[4, 2, 3, 1]
